        <p>Hey guys, it's me! Welcome to my website! I hope you enjoy getting to know a bit about me. </p>
        <h2>Professional Life</h2>
            <p>
                I've had a rollercoaster of a career. I went to school for <span>Musical Theater at BYU</span>, but I also studied business and got exposed to html and other IS stuff. 
                Throughout school I worked all kinds of jobs, from lawncare to factories to fast food to personal assisting to performing. After school I had a brief stint in marketing.
                I didn't enjoy it very much and remembered thriving in the IS class at BYU learning to code. So I am now pursuing web development. Here's a bit of HTML code as an example.
                &lt;h3&gt; This code will display a heading when live on a web page. &lt;/h3&gt;

            <h3>Performing Life</h3>
        <p>I've enjoyed dancing and singing since I was very young, and have been trained in both for a long time. <br/> It seemed natural to major in musical theater when I applied to BYU.
            Performing professionally doesn't work well with a regular schedule and being married to someone working in HR, it didn't seem feasible to perform for my day job. 
            So I've been performing locally in Utah and trying to gain other skills. I still enjoy performing very much. I'm currently in Fiddler on the Roof at Hale Center Theater. 
            I am also teaching voice and piano out of my home.

        <pre>                     Complicated life
            seems when answers don't come easy.
                  But try, don't give up.
